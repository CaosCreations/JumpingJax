  - This level takes the air movement to a new level. The goals are to teach you
    how to get around obstacles, and chain your jumps together fluidly.
  - 'To get around walls: <br>-try standing on the back right corner of the first
    block. <br>- now, aim your crosshair to the left of the window.<br>- run and
    jump, while in the air, hold [D] and look to the right.'
  - The final part of this level features thicker and thicker walls to finely tune
    your newly minted hopping skills! If you get frustrated, take a break. Go play
    some portal levels and come back to this! It takes a lot of breaking habits and
    forming new muscle memory.
