  - This level is to give you an in depth tutorial on bunny hopping. If you don't
    enjoy the mechanic you can skip to the portal levels. However, this level is
    meant to teach you the fundamentals.
  - 'The hardest part about bunny hopping is breaking the habits you''ve learned
    from every FPS games out there. <br>The best advice is to NOT hold W in the air.
    Yes, I know it goes against every part of your soul. '
  - 'To start, let''s examine how the mechanic works. <br> - Step 1: hold [Space]
    to jump, don''t ever let go! <br> - Step 2: Hold [D] and look to the right. Spin
    fast and slow.'
  - 'What did that teach us? <br> 1: while you keep jumping there''s no friction,
    so you don''t slow down <br> 2: to gain speed you MUST combine a directional
    key AND a camera movement <br> 3: if you turn TOO fast, you lose speed. <br>
    4: you need to turn slower as you get going faster, or else you lose speed'
  - 'Lets try the other direction! <br> - Step 1: hold [Space] to jump <br> - Step
    2: Hold [A] and look to the left'
  - Now, try and chain the moves together. <br> - Hold [Space], don't let go! <br>
    - Hold [D] and spin in a circle to the right, to get up to speed <br> - now when
    you're comfortable, hold [A] and look to the left (let go of [D], but not [Space])
    <br> - keep it going. Try to get up to 15 meters per second!
