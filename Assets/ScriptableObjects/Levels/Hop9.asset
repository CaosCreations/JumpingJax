  - 'This level forces you to learn how to gain speed. There are 3 ways to bunny
    hop: <br>- traditional: use A/D after moving forward <br>- backwards: now you
    flip A/D. Use A when looking to the right <br>- sideways: you may use W/S while
    looking to the side of where you want to jump'
  - 'You must gain about 15m/s and jump on the very edge to make it across this gap.
    The quickest way to do this is to: <br>- NEVER PRESS W <br>- Hold SPACE and D,
    while looking to the right. Just keep spinning in circles and watch your speed
    increase'
